## About me

I am currently a Quantum Theory Research Associate at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) where I conduct research in developing and benchmarking algorithms for qudit quantum computers.  
I received my PhD under Prof. Andrei Alexandru at George Washington University, where I developed algorithms to simulate gauge theories on quantum computers.
